# Tcl "gets" Command Unexpected Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the "gets" command in Tcl and presents a robust solution.

The bug occurs when the "gets" command encounters specific characters in a file, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or program termination. The solution utilizes more robust file reading methods to address this issue.  The example illustrates the bug and how the improved function handles edge cases gracefully.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1.  Create a file named `data.txt` with some content, including special characters like null bytes (\0) or control characters. 
2.  Run `bug.tcl`. The script may crash, or it may produce unexpected results.
